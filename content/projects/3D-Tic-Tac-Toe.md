Building 3D Tic Tac Toe using P5.js and React.js. it has multiplayer mode and single player mode with different levels of difficulty and the multiplayer mode is using firebase to store the game data. The project is hosted on GitHub pages and can be accessed [here](https://hossamtarek-bits.github.io/3D-tic-tac-toe). The project is still under development and I'm planning to add more features to it.
