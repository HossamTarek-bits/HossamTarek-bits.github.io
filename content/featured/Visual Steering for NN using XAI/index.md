Our [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-43247-7_4) presents a novel approach to integrating human knowledge with deep neural networks to improve their performance, reduce biases, and leverage human experience. We use attention maps generated by Grad-CAM to highlight the significant parts of an input that most influence the modelâ€™s prediction and detect biases in the dataset. These attention maps are then edited by domain experts to contribute to the training of the model and updating its parameters, leading to better generalization and fewer inductive biases. We apply this approach to several image classification datasets and show that the generated attention maps highly correspond to the edited ones while having high classification performance.
