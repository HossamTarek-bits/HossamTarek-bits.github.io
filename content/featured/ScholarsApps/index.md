A collection of apps for different scholars. The apps contain the scholar's biography, books, articles, and videos. Available on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Salaf+Apps). My work invloved from changing some features to intricate parts as creating a search engine for the books and articles that performs extremely fast.
